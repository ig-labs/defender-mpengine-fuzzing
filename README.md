# Defender MpEngine Fuzzing and Unpatched DoS POCs

This repository contains fuzzing harnesses for [kAFL](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL) and [Jackalope](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/Jackalope) and results in `crashes` for Microsoft Defender's local scanning and emulation engine `mpengine.dll` (Microsoft Malware Portection Engine). The code is based on [mpclient.c](https://github.com/taviso/loadlibrary/blob/master/mpclient.c).

For a detailed write-up of the research, fuzzing methodology, and bug analysis, please refer to the accompanying blog post: **[Attacking EDRs Part 4: Fuzzing Defender's Scanning and Emulation Engine (mpengine.dll)](https://labs.infoguard.ch/posts/attacking_edr_part4_fuzzing_defender_scanning_and_emulation_engine/)**


Microsoft does not plan to address the identified bugs immediately:
> After careful investigation, this case has been assessed as moderate severity and does not meet MSRCâ€™s bar for immediate servicing. 

As of May 2025, most of the bugs to crash Defender (`MsMpEng.exe`) are unpatched and can be abused to execute otherwise blocked malicious actions. Some of them do not crash without PageHeap. Details are described on the [IG-Labs Blog](https://labs.infoguard.ch/posts/attacking_edr_part4_fuzzing_defender_scanning_and_emulation_engine/#results)

**Update:** Shortly after this repository was published, all bugs were fixed silently.

> [!CAUTION]
> The fuzzing was seeded with real Malware from VX-Underground. Therefore, the files in `Crashes` will contain parts of it and you should be careful.

To test the harness without a fuzzer, `mpclient_defender_harness_withoutHypercalls.c` can be used to load the `mpengine.dll` and scan a file using `RSIG_SCAN_STREAMBUFFER`. Enable PageHeap for the binary before executing to catch the bugs. Crash1 does not trigger with this harness. Crash2 crashes defender in normal conditions without PageHeap.

## Example POCs
Crash Defender by clicking a link that triggers a "PDF" download. This could be used in combination with a initial access payload:

Crash defender by uploading a file via SMB before dumping credentials:
